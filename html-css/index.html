        <p1>If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place. 
            When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next logical step is to find a random paragraph. 
            We created the Random Paragraph Generator with you in mind. The process is quite simple. Choose the number of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the button. 
            Your chosen number of paragraphs will instantly appear.
            Try putting some prose onscreen, though, and they mix themselves up pretty quickly. This has much to do with the time constraints we claim to feel in the digital age. We don’t have time to compose letters and post them anymore–much less pay postage, what with all the banks kinda-sorta losing our money these days–so we blast a few emails. </p1>  
        <p2>
            The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. 
            No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.
            Lately, I’ve been noticing how my sentences have a tendency to keep going when I write them onscreen. This goes for concentrated writing as well as correspondence. (Twain probably believed that correspondence, in an ideal world, also demands concentration. But he never used email.) Last week I caught myself packing four conjunctions into a three-line sentence in an email. That’s inexcusable. Since then, I have tried to eschew conjunctions whenever possible. Gone are the commas, the and’s, but’s, and so’s; in are staccato declaratives. Better to read like bad Hemingway than bad Faulkner.
            Most important: What exactly are we writing when we’re doing all of this writing? I won’t pretend to coin a whole new term here; I still think the best we can muster is a more fitting analogue. And if we must find an analogue in an existing literary unit, I propose the paragraph. Our constant writing has begun to feel like a neverending digital paragraph.
            The first option the tool allows you to adjust is the number of random words to be generated. You can choose as many or as few as you'd like. You also have the option of choosing words that only begin with a certain letter, only end with a certain letter or only begin and end with certain letters. If you leave these blank, the randomize words that appear will be from the complete list. </p2>
